Key Features & Highlights:
Dynamic Billing Interface: Users can add items, update quantities, and calculate total amounts in real-time.

Status Tracking: Bills include a "Paid" or "Pending" status, which can be updated dynamically.

Data Storage & Retrieval: Bills are saved in LocalStorage and can be retrieved or modified later.

Popup Notifications: Automatic success message popup when a bill is saved (disappears after 1 second).

Search Functionality: Allows users to search saved bills by name for quick access.

Multi-Page Navigation: The "View Saved Bills" section opens in a separate window for better usability.

Print Functionality: Users can print invoices directly from the application.

Modular Code Structure: The project is divided into multiple files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for better maintainability.

âœ… User-Friendly UI with modern design and responsiveness.
âœ… Efficient Data Management without requiring a database (LocalStorage-based).
âœ… Real-time Status Updates to track payments dynamically.
âœ… Interactive Experience with search, status updates, and notifications.

This project demonstrates frontend development skills, JavaScript-based data handling, and user-focused UI design
